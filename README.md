### README

Problem : https://frontendeval.com/questions/memory-game

Things to look up
1. How to fill an array with ascending numbers
2. How to repeat 18 two times



To improve

1. Couldn't finish within 45mins, first commit is the state i was after 45mins.
    - Do not get stuck by shuffle algo or randomness, move quickly assuming you can use a librray or get back when time permits. Lodash has shuffle
2. Can i pass state variables for example clickCount and setClickCount down the child component?
3. Efficient and optimized way to update state of array of object, updating the array, updating the object prop single or multiple/
4. I had extreme difficluty in finding the game state, started with child component and refactored multiple time to achive the flip of the card logic. A big red flag
5. I was able to finish the problem, atleast the first usecase in 2 hours (red flag), but there is a bug. 
    - I did not clear the matches after game finish
    - The cards are not disapperaing after the game.
    - Flipping back bothe the cards after incorrect match is also wrong, i updated only 1 item from macth,

6. Cards are not removign after successful match. Yet to try again.
